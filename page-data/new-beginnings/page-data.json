I bet you’re wondering what you are doing here. I am hoping\nthat you stumbled upon this because you are perhaps an engineering student, hopefully an undergrad,\nand looking to figure out what to do during the summer, or next semester, or looking for\nsomething to set you apart. You have come to the right place. I am here to explain\nto you what is a co-op assignment and why you want one. I’ll probably throw in a bit\nof history for you too.</p>\n<h2>So what is a co-op?</h2>\n<p>Co-op is a shortened form of cooperative education. It is basically a collaboration between\nuniversities and industry to give students real-world on the job experience. Usually it manifests in\nstudents working for semester, going to school the next semester, then going back to work the semester\nafter that, then back to school, then…well you get the picture.</p>\n<h3>Short history lesson</h3>\n<p>Cooperative education actually began with Herman Schneider at the University of Cincinnati (my alma mater!)\nin 1906. You can read more <a href=\"https://magazine.uc.edu/issues/1205/success1.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why do I want to co-op?</h2>\n<h2>How’s this different from an internship?</h2>\n<p>Sometimes nothing, sometimes a lot. Companies with great co-op programs will welcome you back\nfor multiple semesters so you can continue your learning, gain more experience, learn what you\nlike and don’t like about what you’re doing, and give you the opportunity to continually\ncontribute more and more to whatever the company is doing. An internship is usually a one-time\nexperience with a company, and they are sometimes shorter than a full semester, and don’t always focus\non growing and investing in you so that you are able to make a meaningful contribution to their normal\nbusiness initiatives. Sometimes they’ll focus on projects that are created specifically for interns\nand are not part of normal business operations.</p>\n<p> Co-op programs should work to integrate you into\nwhat is normally going on and include you as just another engineer on the team, not put you in a corner\nwith other co-ops. Now I used the words <code class=\"language-text\">sometimes</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">usually</code> because this isn’t always the case.\nThere are always exceptions to this, but in general, this is the distinction. Always, always, always ask\nquestions to figure out what the company’s programs are like to get a feel for this.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"What is a co-op?","date":"July 14, 2020","description":"Describes what is an engineering co-op assignment and the differences between a co-op and an internship."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/my-second-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"My Second Post!"}},"next":null}}}
