I bet you’re wondering what you are doing here. I am hoping
that you stumbled upon this because you are perhaps an engineering student, hopefully an undergrad,
and looking to figure out what to do during the summer, or next semester, or looking for
something to set you apart. You have come to the right place. I am here to explain
to you what is a co-op assignment and why you want one. I’ll probably throw in a bit
of history for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what is a co-op?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-op is a shortened form of cooperative education. It is basically a collaboration between
universities and industry to give students real-world on the job experience. Usually it manifests in
students working for semester, going to school the next semester, then going back to work the semester
after that, then back to school, then…well you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Short history lesson&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperative education actually began with Herman Schneider at the University of Cincinnati (my alma mater!)
in 1906. You can read more &lt;a href=&quot;https://magazine.uc.edu/issues/1205/success1.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do I want to co-op?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How’s this different from an internship?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes nothing, sometimes a lot. Companies with great co-op programs will welcome you back
for multiple semesters so you can continue your learning, gain more experience, learn what you
like and don’t like about what you’re doing, and give you the opportunity to continually
contribute more and more to whatever the company is doing. An internship is usually a one-time
experience with a company, and they are sometimes shorter than a full semester, and don’t always focus
on growing and investing in you so that you are able to make a meaningful contribution to their normal
business initiatives. Sometimes they’ll focus on projects that are created specifically for interns
and are not part of normal business operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Co-op programs should work to integrate you into
what is normally going on and include you as just another engineer on the team, not put you in a corner
with other co-ops. Now I used the words &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sometimes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;usually&lt;/code&gt; because this isn’t always the case.
There are always exceptions to this, but in general, this is the distinction. Always, always, always ask
questions to figure out what the company’s programs are like to get a feel for this.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My Second Post!]]></title><description><![CDATA[Wow!

I love blogging so much already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.”?
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;Wikipedia Link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I didn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

How exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ll write a lot more interesting things in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and here’s a great quote from this Wikipedia on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg&quot;&gt;salted duck eggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
